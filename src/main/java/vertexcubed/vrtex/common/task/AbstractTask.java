/**
 * <p>
 *     Represents a task that can be added to a TaskManager. A task can be any arbitrary function,

 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     A task has four possible states: pending, interrupted, completed, or fail. While a task is
 *     being calculated, it is considered pending. An interrupted task is a task that has been
 *     forcibly ended <b>externally</b>, while a failed task is a task that has been ended
 *     <b>internally</b>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Tasks are <b>mutable</b> objects, thus their state changes over time.
 *     Make sure to not call update multiple times per execution step!
